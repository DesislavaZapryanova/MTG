        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>Magic: The Gathering is a collectable card game with extremely detailed, and at times, complex rules. However, only a basic understanding of the rules is necessary to play the game. The most important rule is that if the text on a card contradicts a game rule, the card text always takes precedence. Magic: The Gathering is thus constantly breaking its own rules, making it a challenging and intricate game.
        </p>
        <h3>Zones: Areas of Play</h3>
        <h4>Library</h4>
        <p>A player's deck. These cards are kept face down and should be randomly ordered (which means, shuffled at the beginning of the game). It must contain at least 60 cards in Constructed play, or at least 40 cards in Limited play. There is no maximum deck size, although there may only be 4 of any nonbasic land card. It is recommended to have 25 land, basic or nonbasic, and 35 spells (creatures, instants, sorceries, artifacts, enchantments and planeswalkers).
        </p>
        <h4>Graveyard</h4>
        <p>A player's discard pile. When a card in play is destroyed, or an instant or sorcery is taken off the stack, it is put in its owner's graveyard. These cards are face up, and can be examined by any player at any time. Several cards, like Disentomb or Rise from the Grave, allow you to take cards from a graveyard and return them to your hand, on the battlefield, or somewhere in your library.
        </p>
        <h4>Hand</h4>
        <p>A player's hand of cards. They are normally kept hidden from other players; however, cards like Telepathy and a number of "discard" spells can allow players to look at some or all of the cards in other players' hands. The number of cards each player has is public. If you have more than 7 cards in your hand at the end of your turn, you must discard until you have only 7 cards in your hand; as always, cards like the Artifact Spellbook can override this.
        </p>
        <h4>Stack</h4>
        <p>This is the place for cards that have been cast but not yet resolved. Activated abilities and triggered abilities also go on the stack until they resolve. This zone is shared by all players. See the stack.
        </p>
        <h4>Battlefield</h4>
        <p>Most cards need to enter the battlefield before they can affect the game. All players share a single battlefield. All permanents stay on the battlefield unless effects or the rules instruct players to remove them.</p>
        <h4>Exile</h4>
        <p>This is where cards that have been exiled are placed: to exile a card means to take it from its current zone and place it in this zone. The text of a card may specify that a card is exiled face-down; if it does not, the card is exiled face-up. Some examples of cards that exile other cards are Iona's Judgement and Celestial Purge. Some cards, Journey to Nowhere and Oblivion Ring being two examples, exile cards, but later return them to the battlefield.</p>
