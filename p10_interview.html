        <h1>Elaine Chase Interview: Magic Arena Jumps Into Esports</h1>
        <p>VP of Esports for Magic: The Gathering Elaine Chase discusses the future of Magic Arena and why now is the right time to start an esports program.

        <p>Vice President, Esports for Magic: The Gathering Elaine Chase is ready for Magic to kick the door down and enter the world of esports in a big way. After over twenty years spent working for Wizards of the Coast, Chase is a veteran of the gaming industry and has been integral in Magic's growth into the dominant tabletop presence it is today. Now, her and the rest of the company have their eyes set on an even bigger prize: the lucrative and burgeoning esports scene, which was tagged to make upwards of $900 million in revenue in 2018 alone. That's why Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro are launching Magic esports, an esports program that will infuse Magic: The Gathering Arena and paper Magic with an extra $10 million in prizes in 2019.

        We spoke with Chase about the launch of Magic esports and the company's lofty goals regarding Magic's place within the online scene, and she revealed some exciting details about how the new program will dramatically alter the landscape of Magic - both in its digital and paper forms. With the esports industry growing at a rapid pace, Chase and Wizards of the Coast are finally ready to launch Magic: The Gathering into the future of competitive gaming.
        </p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reropter:</i> Obviously this announcement is a lot to unpack, so the first thing I wanted to ask was just, how long has the decision to launch Magic esports been in the works?
        </p>
        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: So, as you know Magic has been around for 25 years, we’re in our 25th anniversary, and we’ve been pioneers in a lot of different spaces over those 25 years right - we’re the first, and I think the best, TCG in the world, we were the first digital TCG when Magic Online released in 2002, we were the first competitive gaming with the Pro Tour when it launched in 1996 - but for us, coming out with MTG Arena as a new, modern digital platform, to be able to play the awesome game of Magic, is a perfect opportunity for us to expand on our legacy in competitive gaming and with Magic and really make a big splash and a big push into esports proper.
        </p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> So it’s something that you’ve been planning for a number of years at this point?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Yeah, it’s really been baked into the entire strategy of MTG Arena. MTG Arena was built from the ground up to be just as much fun to stream and watch it as it is to play it, and it is going to  be that entry into esports for us.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reropter:</i> How much of Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast’s stance on Magic: The Gathering and esports, and how much it is going to impact the future of Magic, has changed with the reception of Magic Arena?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: We’re very much building a system that in 2019 has ten million dollars in prizes on the line across both MTG Arena and tabletop. We’re building the system to leverage our legacy that we have in tabletop competitive gaming and even amplify that as we build it side by side with the MTG Arena Esports program, so the two of them kind of intertwine and compliment each other.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Was it always the plan to split the prize pools for this evenly between paper and Arena, or did that change because Arena has become so popular so quickly?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: It’s always been the plan for us to kind of look at both MTG Arena and tabletop as key pillars of the business. To be honest, one isn’t more important than the other, we want players to be able to play Magic when and where they want to play Magic, and we want to be able to support their choice either way.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Magic esports is described as allowing “all Magic players the opportunity to compete.” Are you referring to both casual and competitive players, and how will you get both those groups to compete?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Our program has two main pillars to it. One pillar is the formation of the Magic Pro League, which is us creating a new level of professional play, with a league that’s comprised of 32 of the highest ranked players from around the world. So those players are going to be kind of the core of what you see stories built around as the events unfold over the course of 2019. But those MPL players will be playing against challengers from the community who have a chance to qualify both in tabletop and in MTG Arena and to be able to play in those Mythic Championships and challenge those MPL players.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> The 32 players are going to be a major part of this program. Is this a new step in player branding for Wizards?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Certainly! We want to be able to take our players who have proven themselves as the world’s greatest Magic players throughout our tabletop competitive scene and kind of help them with the transition into MTG Arena esports.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Quick question on the 32 as well - is there already a system built into place on how you’re going to determine the 32 initially</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: We’ll be talking about the player roster over the next couple of weeks.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Now with Arena being a major point of focus - and I know this has been asked several times before but maybe not in the context of Magic esports - where does Hasbro and Wizards see Magic: The Gathering Online fitting into this?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Magic Online offers a fundamentally different experience than MTG Arena. Magic Online continues to offer all of the cards throughout Magic’s robust history and lots of different formats in play that MTG Arena doesn’t focus on. MTG Arena is really focusing on the best fun way to play front list Magic and all the new cards that are coming out. So Magic Online will continue to exist and to support that kind of extended card list and format play.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> That being said, Modern continues to be one of the most popular formats in Magic. Is there any kind of inclination or planning that might see that implemented in Magic Arena in the future?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Right now we’re focusing on getting the game through open beta and leading up to our wide launch and we’ll consider other kinds of formats and card sets and things like that in the future.</p>

        <img src="images/mtg_arena.jpg" alt="mtg_arena" class="int_pic">

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> I know that there’s been a lot of discussion within the pro player community about how Magic can help its players out, how it can push esports further, and Magic kind of responded to that recently with the introduction of Pro Player Consultants. How much input did they have in the way Magic Pro League is being structured?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Significant. We’ve been working very closely with them, they’ve been giving us blunt and brutal and honest feedback as we’ve built the program, which has been wonderful. It’s really given us a pipeline into the players’ thoughts and minds and wishes and desires.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Is there any information yet on how Magic esports is going to affect things like the Pro Player Club?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Players in the MPL, and other players who are the challengers who are able to rise through the ranks and have good finishes in those Mythic Championships, will end up getting ranked based on their performances in those Mythic events, and the Pro Club itself will end up phasing out over 2019.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> So the pros and challengers will be ranked by Mythic events - is there going to be a ranking system for the vast majority of Arena players [who might not play these events] as well?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Over the next couple weeks we’ll be talking more about MTG Arena ranking systems.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Arena is eventually going to have to deal with Standard rotation and players having cards that aren’t useable anymore. Are there any plans in place already on how Wizards is going to handle that?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Our intent for sure is to have Arena’s Standard plus format. We don’t have any details to share on exactly what that looks like but don’t worry, players will still be able to use all their cards that rotate out.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> You said that there were a lot of changes coming for the Pro Players club. Does that mean there are a lot of changes coming for Grand Prix and Pro Tours as well?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: The Grand Prix schedule for 2019 is going to remain exactly how it has been announced. It’s still a very critical part of our program and rewards 2 and a half million dollars in prizes alone by itself in its dozens of events that it has throughout the world. The Pro Tours themselves are actually going to be transitioning into Mythic Championships themselves. We’re making it different because we really want to separate out the professional Magic players in the MPL from the tournaments that are open to the public that can come in and challenge them. So we’re unifying all our flagship championship events under the banner of Mythic Championships whether they’re in tabletop or MTG Arena.</p>
        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Will the World Championships still be separate from that banner?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: The end of 2019, the capstone event is going to be a spectacular World Championship event, and we’ll have more to talk about [regarding] that as the year starts up.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Does this mean we’ll see less of the top professional players playing paper Magic?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase:All of the players in the MPL are also invited to all of the tabletop Mythic Championships so you’ll see them playing in both platforms.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Will the Mythic Championships that are online and the paper ones coincide in any way or are they separate from each other?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: They’re separate events.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> So online is going to be handled separately then?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: Yes, MTG Arena events will be handled separately.</p>

        <p class="report"><i>Reporter:</i> Anything else you’d like to say?</p>

        <p class="elaine">Elaine Chase: We’re really looking forward to that $1 million dollar prize pool Invitational kick-off at PAX East, and the biggest thing I would say to people out there who want to get involved is to download MTG Arena and to start building up your skills and your reputation today and get ready. I hope to see you in game!</p>
