      <h1>Golgari Swarm</h1>
      <p>The Golgari Swarm is a black/green guild from the plane and city of Ravnica. Introduced in Ravnica: City of Guilds, the guild is also featured in Return to Ravnica, the Izzet vs. Golgari set and in Guilds of Ravnica. The Golgari Swarm is the embodiment of life and death. The teeming masses of the Swarm believe that life and death are both natural  and equally essential too. To them, life and death are natural elements of a cycle with no intermediary break. Growth is power that comes slowly, but it is also ruthless and inevitable, and this makes growth a key virtue of the Swarm's power. Their necromantic magic has made the Golgari the largest Ravnican guild. Much like a swarm of insects, the Golgari often seem to behave more like a single organism than as a group of individuals. The whole Swarm is driven by a primal instinct to survive and reproduce. The Golgari Swarm's consists of many sub-factions, each with its own agenda. Their revered parun is the legendary necromancer Svogthir, the "god-zombie".
      </p>
      <h3>Teratogens</h3>
      <p>Up until the Decamillennial, the Teratogens were the ruling class of the Golgari. It consisted mostly of non-humanoids such as plants, mutants, harpies, nagas, griffins, and centaurs. Nowadays they are of no importance anymore.

      <h3>The Devkarin</h3>
      <p>The Devkarin are a brooding, winsome, and often ambitious race of elves. Of all of Golgari's factions, the Devkarin press most for the expansion of Golgari territory. The Devkarin are presided over by their "Matka", a high priestess (currently Izoni, Thousand-Eyed).
      </p>
      <h3>The Lotleth</h3>
      <p>The Lotleth are the Golgari's irregular faction of undead, necromancers, fungus-binders, and other members associated with the restless dead. Although most Golgari undead are mindless fungal constructions maintained by necromantic magic, the Lotleth do have some more or less intelligent undead among them, plus a few higher-ranked necromancers who speak for the faction. Generally, the Lotleth serve as a labor force for the Golgari's constant program of reclamation and expansion. The current leader of the Lotleth is Wratislav, a skilled but conceited human necromancer.
      </p>

      <h3>The Kraul</h3>
      <p>The Kraul lived for ages on the periphery of the Swarm, but are now an ascendant group with the Swarm. These six-legged insectile beings are hard-headed and literal-minded. Under Mazirek, the Kraul are loyal to Vraska, rather than to the Swarm as a whole. Their military are known as the Krunstraz.
      </p>
      <h3>The Erstwhile</h3>
      <p>A delicate and sophisticated race of elves known as the Erstwhile once were an important faction in Ravnica. They were laid to rest in coffins in Umerilek, Mausoleum of the Erstwhile. They returned as Zombie Attendants of Vraska. In contrast to the regular fungus-animated zombies of the Golgari, they retain a higher degree of intellegence and agency. They continue to wear their stately attire, despite its moldering and rot. The leader of the Erstwhile is the lich Storrev.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Founded by parun Svogthir, a human necromancer-turned-lich, the Golgari Swarm functions as the agricultural sector of Ravnican society. Following his mortal death, Svogthir reanimated his own corpse. He also modified his body by incorporating body parts from others - he used the chest of Gruul Clans parun Cisarzim, for instance, to create a more perfect, stronger being.

      <h3>Ravnica block</h3>
      <p>During the Ravnica block storyline, the leadership of the Golgari was contested time and again, in large part due to the numerous factions vying for control of their guild. The most prominent among these were the Devkarin (dark elves), of which Savra was the head, and the Teratogens,[10] which was predominantly composed of plant–zombie hybrids as well as, albeit to lesser extents, giant bats, gorgons, harpies, and other monstrous creatures. Up until the events of the Decamillennial, the Teratogens maintained hegemony over the Golgari Swarm.
      Less than a millennium prior to the Decamillennial, the Sisters of Stone Death, originally a quintet of gorgons, attempted to overthrow parun Svogthir. Although two of the sisters died, they were successful in their coup and were able to destroy, and rot away, all but Svogthir's head, which his necromantic magic kept intact. The remaining three sisters — Ludmilla, Lexya, and Lydya — kept Svogthir under arrest in a tomb in Grigor Canyon. At the turn of the Decamillennial, the Devkarin, led by matka (high priestess) Savra, who, with the help of the House Dimir parun and guildmaster Szadek, overtook control of the guild. Savra resurrected Svogthir, whom she used to overthrow the Sisters of Stone Death, and then used ancient, powerful matka magic to liberate his spirit from his head, so that she could add it to her scepter. Subsequent to this, Savra proclaimed herself as the new Golgari guildmaster. Power-hungry as always, Savra then attempted to infiltrate the Selesnya Conclave with her quietmen and tried to subtly sieze control of the Conclave; but, she was double-crossed by Szadek, who snapped her neck so as to weaken the Conclave. In Dissension, Szadek is defeated with the help of Savra's brother, Jarad, who assumes control of the Golgari Swarm. He was later sacrificed by Izolda (Lyzolda, the Blood Witch) as part of a ritual to arouse Rakdos, the parun of the Cult of Rakdos. Jarad, however, "survives", by using necromancy to become a zombie/lich, and retains his mantle of leadership over the Golgari. The guildhall of the Golgari Swarm in the Ravnica block is Svogthos, a former elaborately decorated and gilded cathedral of the Orzhov Syndicate. Svogthos is a semi-living structure in which the detached, severed head of Svogthir, is housed, and is claimed to move as the center of Golgari territory shifts.
