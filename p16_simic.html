        <h1>Simic Combine</h1>
        <p>The Simic Combine is the green/blue guild from the plane and city of Ravnica. Introduced in Dissension, the guild is also featured in Gatecrash and Ravnica Allegiance. The Simic Combine is Ravnica's steward of nature and the wild; its mission is to preserve the natural world even as Ravnica's cities continue to grow. The guild seeks to protect the elements of the plane that are incompatible or mutually exclusive with its overpopulated, urban conditions. The guild uses magic to coax new morphologies from existing creatures, as well as to combine traits from multiple organisms in one. Some of these are unique creatures that can't reproduce. A few multiply and become part of the guild's fabric. The emotionally distant relationship that the Simic biomancers have with the rest of Ravnica's society makes the common man wary of the guild, thinking of them as crazy mutant makers. Even so, the Simic make up the physicians of Ravnica and so injuries and illness are taken to the reputable doctors.
        </p>
        <h3>Clades</h3>
        <p>Where other cultures are divided by species, caste or role, within the Simic Combine, members are divided by Clade. A Clade is a group that's focused on a specific aspect or project. Some of the clades include:
        </p>
        <img src="images/simic_guild.jpg" alt="" class="plane_img">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hull Clade</b>, focussing on protection, defense and durability.</li>
          <li><b>Fin Clade</b>, focussing on movement of creatures (especially flying creatures) as well as, movement of resources through systems.</li>
          <li><b>Crypsis Clade</b>, focussing on camouflage and magic designed to hide knowledge or operations.</li>
          <li><b>Gyre Clade</b>, focussing on redirecting or nullifying magic and advancing nature.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Factions</h3>
        <p>Independently from the Clades operate factions about the interpretation of Simic philosophy. Two are known: The Utopians, who focus on a harmonic union between civilization and nature, where evolution is a slow, guided process; and the Adaptationists, who believe that the guilds exist in a fragile ecosystem in which the slightest imbalance can have cascading effects, and thus seek to make steps that will ensure their survival. Though not ouright stated, it is likely that Momir Vig's followers constituted their own factions, the Vigians, who saw nature as something to be molded and subdued in order to enhance civilization

        <h1>Storyline</h1>
        <h3>Ravnica block</h3>
        <img src="images/simic_guild3.jpg" alt="" class="plane_img">
        <p>The original purpose of the Simic Combine was to preserve the health of all Ravnican life-forms. They were devoted to the study of life, medicines, and biomancy. But just as life can adapt, so did the Combine. Momir Vig, the Simic guildmaster, was dissatisfied with this original purpose and formed a new purpose: to improve upon life-forms of Ravnica. For this, he created cytoplasts, a bio-magical mass of living tissue, appearing as blue-green globules. These globules convey genetic information to and from any life-form they come into physical contact with. Unfortunately for Vig, the people of Ravnica did not want to be improved or to undergo the surgery required to receive the benefits (except Simic members and people requiring prosthetics), so Vig created a new version of cytoplast that only need to come into contact with a host in order to bond with it. This allowed Vig to improve the people of Ravnica without needing their consent. Vig allied with Svogthir and planned to create and activate his Project Kraj to cleanse Ravnica and start over. He was consequently killed by Agrus Kos. Because of Vigs actions, the Simic were rejected, their symbol omitted from some art pieces with guild symbols. The Simic were left in disrepair until Ravnica's subterranean merfolk emerged.
        </p>
        <h3>Return to Ravnica block</h3>
        <p>With the reemergence of the guilds and the rediscovery of Ravnica's long gone oceans, through the sinkholes known as Zonots, the Simic were remade from scratch. Embracing long-gone spiritual and holistic concepts of the reappeared merfolk, they rejected Momir Vig's corrupted philosophy and focused on advancing nature through purely magical means. Because of their new focus on the oceans, their philosophy revolves around principles applied to sea-life: the Holdfast, the anchoring, isolationist motion; and the Upwelling, the expansive, upwards-going motion. With this, they form a compromise between isolation and influence on Ravnican society, preserving nature and allowing at least one spot of access to the underground oceans. The merfolk Zegana became the guildmaster and speaker of Zonot One, the first to open. The nine Zonots are the focus of Simic activity, with Zonot Seven being home to Zameck, the guildhall.
        </p>
        <h3>Guilds of Ravnica block</h3>
        <p>After Golgari incursions began to threaten Zonot Four, Zegana was replaced as Prime Speaker by Vannifar, a member of the Adaptationist faction who stood for a more practical leadership. Under Vannifar the Simic started the Guardian Project to mutate their more intelligent members into super soldiers. Most Simic scientists and their creations now have gills, and have their experimental units in underwater labs called holdfasts, deep within the zonots. After the Boros Legion and House Dimir declared their opposition to Nicol Bolas in the Event, Ral Zarek lead the Izzet into battle against the dragon, and convinced the Simic Combine to join him as well.</p>

        <h2>In the game</h2>
        <h3>Guild mechanics</h3>
        <h4>Dissension: Graft</h4>
        <p>The Graft mechanic is indicative of cytoplasts; specifically, the "newer" ones of Momir Vig's design. A creature with the Graft keyword comes into play with +1/+1 counters and can later transfer them on to other newly-played creatures.
        </p>
        <img src="images/simic_guild2.jpg" alt="" class="plane_img">
        <h4>Gatecrash: Evolve</h4>
        <p>Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature has greater power or toughness than this creature, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.
        </p>
        <h4>Ravnica Allegiance: Adapt</h4>
        <p>If a creature has no +1/+1 counters on it, you may pay the adapt cost to put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.</p>
