        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>Magic can be played by two or more players, either in person with printed cards or on a computer, smartphone or tablet with virtual cards through the Internet-based software Magic: The Gathering Online or other video games such as Magic: The Gathering Arena. It can be played in various rule formats, which fall into two categories: constructed and limited. Limited formats involve players building a deck spontaneously out of a pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards; in constructed formats, players create decks from cards they own, usually with a minimum of 60 cards per deck.

        New cards are released on a regular basis through expansion sets. An organized tournament system (the DCI) played at the international level and a worldwide community of professional Magic players has developed, as well as a substantial resale market for Magic cards. Certain cards can be monetarily valuable due to their rarity in production and utility in gameplay, with prices ranging from a few cents to thousands of dollars.
      </p>

        <p>The story of Magic The Gathering was always focused around extraordinary individuals who were able to travel freely within the Multiverse. In the early years, these stories would often focus around the plane of Dominaria, Urza, the Weatherlight Crew and the Phyrexian invasion. Later, the story started to utilize the block structure of the releases. Each block would introduce a new plane, and with the Mending, the story focus would shift towards various Planeswalkers who would explore these planes. Some planes would be revisited in later blocks.

        Novels and comics were the main form of distribution until Magic Story - a weekly short story column - was introduced. The paper releases have been discontinued, but the Magic Story is available for free on the Wizards of the Coast website.

        In recent events the Gatewatch was founded to answer in multi-planar threats like the Eldrazi or Nicol Bolas. Whenever a plane was in need of help, they would be there to protect its inhabitants.

        <h2 id="colors">The colors of Magic</h2>
        <p><b>Magic</b> recognizes five colors for mechanical purposes: white, blue, black, red, and green. Each card may be any of these colors, or colorless. A card may also be multicolored, and a hybrid subset of multicolored cards offer additional flexibility.
        <br>Each color has characteristic strategies, mechanics, and philosophies. These properties derive from commonplace associations with the colors themselves, and from the practical considerations of creating good gameplay. The "color pie", or color wheel, is a mnemonic device and creative tool based on the ring of colored dots on the back of Magic cards. For any particular color, the color pie uses adjacency on that ring to split the other colors into a pair of neighboring allied colors and a more distant pair of enemy colors.

          <p>In the game of Magic, guilds are represented by two-colored pairings of Magic's five colors and have, to date, been predominantly featured in the Ravnica, Return to Ravnica and Guilds of Ravnica blocks.
          The Guilds of Ravnica are ten sociopolitical factions that hold power on the city plane of Ravnica. Each guild has its own distinct ideology that unifies its members with one another, with the guild itself, with its functions and purposes, and with its structure.

        <h2 id="mana_system">Mana System</h2>
        <p><b>Mana</b> is the primary resource for playing spells. Mana is typically drawn from lands (like the basic lands Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest) but it can also be generated by non-land permanents and spells. Players choose whatever cards they want. In order for that to work, the game needs some way to make as many cards as possible matter. By making spells have a cost, the designers are able to make different cards important at different parts of the game. Because of this, each card now has a different reason to be considered for a deck. This diversity of card usage is a key factor in making the entire trading card game work.

        <h2 id="cards">Card types</h2>
        <p><b>A card type</b> is a characteristic that each Magic: The Gathering card has. Each card type has its own rules for how they are played. The main card types are: artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land. planeswalker and sorcery. Some objects may have more than one card type (e.g., artifact creature). Additionally, cards may have supertypes or subtypes.

            <dt><b><a href="page1.html#lands" target="_blank" class="links">Land</a></b></dt>
            <dd>Land is a type of permanent and may have the subtype Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, or Swamp. (There are other less common land subtypes.) A land may be played only once per turn and only by the active player (the player whose turn it is) on his or her turn.</dd>

            <dt><b><a href="page1.html#creatures" target="_blank" class="links">Creature</a></b></dt>
            <dd>Creature is a type of permanent and will have one or other creature types (e.g. Elf, Cat, Dragon, Wurm). All creatures have a power and a toughness and are the only card type that can attack or block. Some creatures have power and toughness depending on a certain thing, like Nightmare. Many creatures have abilities that boost their value and make them more powerful.</dd>

            <dt><b><a href="page1.html#Artifacts" target="_blank" class="links">Artifacts</a></b></dt>
            <dd>Artifact is a type of permanent and may also be a creature, or an artifact creature. That means that anything that affects an artifact or a creature can be used on an artifact creature. So if you have Naturalize, you can use it on an artifact creature.</dd>

            <dt><b><a href="page1.html#enchantment" target="_blank" class="links">Enchantment</a></b></dt>
            <dd>Enchantment is a type of permanent and may have the subtype Aura. Unlike the similar permanent, the artifact, enchantments are colored and never need to tap.</dd>

            <dt><b><a href="page1.html#planeswalker" target="_blank" class="links">Planeswalker</a></b></dt>
            <dd>Planeswalker is a type of permanent and may have one planeswalker subtype. All planeswalkers have a loyalty and three or four abilities that add or subtract loyalty. Only one of these abilities may be played per turn. Also, if a player controls two or more planeswalkers with the same planeswalker subtype at the same time, all but one of them is put into their owner's graveyard.</dd>

            <dt><b><a href="page1.html#sorcery" target="_blank" class="links">Sorcery</a></b></dt>
            <dd>Sorcery is a type of nonpermanent and may have the subtype Arcane.</dd>

            <dt><b><a href="page1.html#instants" target="_blank" class="links">Instant</a></b></dt>
            <dd>Instant is a type of nonpermanent and may have the subtype Arcane or Trap. Instants and spells with Flash are the only card types that can be played on either player's turn.</dd>

        <h2 id="rarity">Rarity</h2>
        <p><strong>Rarity</strong> defines the scarcity of cards in boosters, and indicates complexity, but not the quality of the card, although rarer cards are sometimes more powerful and more highly sought after. Rares can generally be said to be more complex, but not necessarily better, than commons.
