        <p>In Theros, the pantheon of gods vies for undying devotion among their mortal subjects. But in the Underworld, there is only one master: the Lord of the Dead. Break free from death's shackles as a hero reborn. Choose your god and fight in their name...or forge a destiny all your own.</p>
        <p>Theros is ruled by an awe-inspiring pantheon of gods. Mortals tremble before them, feel the sting of their petty whims, and live in terror of their wrath. It is a plane where barbaric, cave-dwelling minotaurs descend on wayward travelers. Giants stalk the land, drawing strength from the terrain on which they tread. At sea, massive krakens prowl its depths, and sirens lure its sailors to their demise. Yet amid such colossal perils, mortals have found a way to endure, and it is here that the hero's mantle is raised highest. Not only have the mortals endured, they have managed to thrive, for Theros is also a plane where civilization is protected behind the walls of great poleis, each city-state a bulwark against the raging monsters that roam the more savage places of Theros. Meletis, the polis of learning, progress, magic, and devotion to the gods, is a testament to the achievements of civilized humanity. It is hemmed in by vast golden wheat fields and the Siren Sea, and defended by the Reverent Army. In the polis of Akros, martial prowess is held in the highest esteem. Akroan warriors have reached near-mythic status throughout Theros. The imposing cliff-top fortress of Akros lies at the center of a network of outposts that serve to protect the rest of Theros, a fact that comforts many Therans. Setessa, the isolated polis surrounded by concentric rings of forest, is fiercely independent. Strong bonds connect its inhabitants, and all in Setessa share a veneration of nature.

        <h1>MAKING FETCH HAPPEN—SECRET LAIR: ULTIMATE EDITION</h1>
        <p>Coming to a store near you, Secret Lair: Ultimate Edition is making fetch happen. Yes, your local game store. Featuring art from five of Magic's premier artists—Alayna Danner, Adam Paquette, Sam Burley, John Avon, and Seb McKinnon—set in five popular Magic planes, this collection of five enemy fetch lands is sure to turn heads.

          <p>With the excitement over the Secret Lair Drop Series, we were looking for an opportunity to combine Secret Lair's brand of exciting art with cards players want in their local game store. We're still new to the Secret Lair thing (And we're having a blast with it, thank you very much!), but we're excited to explore ways to get more versions of Secret Lair, like Ultimate Edition, into local stores. </p>
          <p>Secret Lair: Ultimate Edition will contain one non-foil copy of each of these cards, and you can only get the grouping of five at your local game store starting May 29. Copies are limited—stores will typically receive no more than 10 copies of Ultimate Edition—so make sure to check with your local game store. While the vast majority of these will go out through WPN stores, there will be another opportunity to pick these up. The week after these go on sale at WPN stores, we'll be running a Secret Lair superdrop much like we did in December. We'll share more details about all of the drops closer to June, but the one detail we can share today is that if you purchase the bundle that combines each drop that goes on sale during the superdrop, you'll receive one random fetch land for each bundle you purchase.

          <p>Speaking of old favorites, this isn't the last time you'll see fetch lands this year, either. While they will not be entering Standard in 2020 (let's put that rumor to rest right now—having these in abundance still isn't a play pattern we want in Standard), there will be another way to pick up some stylized versions of fetch lands later this year that will also be in your local game store. Why are we making fetch happen again in 2020? Well, it is the Year of Commander, after all, and many players enjoy these special lands in their multicolor decks. Plus, we know players need these for Modern, and we haven't printed new versions of these since 2017. But, really, it's so we could use the headline "Making Fetch Happen," because all the best jokes reference 2004. There's even more coming from Secret Lair in 2020, so stay tuned and stay in touch with your local store for more on Secret Lair: Ultimate Edition.
