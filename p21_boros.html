        <h1>Boros Legion</h1>
        <p>The Boros Legion is a red/white guild from the plane and city of Ravnica. Introduced in Ravnica: City of Guilds, the guild is also featured in Gatecrash and Guilds of Ravnica. The Boros Legion was founded by parun Razia, a militant flaming-sword-wielding archangel capable of using flame and light magic who fervently and firmly believed in harmonious coexistence on Ravnica, even if lives were lost and blood was shed in achieving this. The Legion functions as the righteous and zealous constabulary and standing army of Ravnica, as the League of Wojek and Boros Army, respectively, and enforces Ravnican laws created by the Azorius Senate. The Boros Legion is known to use many fire spells. The Guildhall of the Boros is Sunhome, a combined fortress, barracks, and place of worship.
        </p>
        <h3>Old Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>As it was originally envisioned, the Boros Legion had a complicated, contrived, and highly stratified hierarchy, with the upper levels comprising angels and guildmages and lower levels comprising the League of Wojek and the Boros Army. A Boros could only employ the spells of an equal or lesser power band.

        <h3>Angels</h3>
        <p>Angels were above and outside of the regular hierarchy. They provided inspiration and direction and only occasionally do they swing their fiery swords in battle. Any angel of any status outranked a mortal Boros member.
        </p>
         <ul>
          <li><b>Power Band 1: Razia</b> — military leader and icon, inspiration and demi-god, all within the Legion knew and respected her.</li>
          <li><b>Power Band 2: the Angelic Warleaders</b> — wise and ancient angels serving as the tacticians of the guild and as counselors to the Archangel. They charted spiritual campaigns over hundreds of years, and set the dogma of the guild, making certain that it reflected the command of their leader.</li>
          <li><b>Power Band 3: Firemane Angels</b> — incarnations of war, serving in the capacity of holy warriors. Not involved in strategy or politics.</li>
          <li><b>Power Band 4: Battleforce Angels</b> — The rank and file of the angel echelon. They are strong and loyal and many.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Interregnum</h3>
        <p>During the days of the Interregnum after the death of Razia and many other high-ranking officials of the guild, the Boros mainly worked as paid bodyguards and security officials for the highest bidders, mostly Orzhov families. Many were discontent with this new style of leadership under guildmaster Feather and gathered under the war-leader Aurelia, who argued that no disgraced angel should lead the Boros.
        </p>
        <img src="images/boros_door.jpg" alt="" class="plane_img">
        <h3>The new Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>After Aurelia assumed the office of guildmaster, she established several changes to the way the guild was run. While she maintained both the army and the Wojek, angels were now encouraged to mingle with the lower ranks and Aurelia enforced practicality over tradition among them. In addition, Aurelia has split leadership of the bulk of the legion into four "theatres" that mainly deal with threats to the public order:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Theatre of Order:</b> tasked to fight against Rakdos incursions and their clubs.</li>
          <li><b>The Theatre of Integrity:</b> tasked to find the sleeper agents and hidden refuges of the Dimir and root any members of this subversive guild out</li>
          <li><b>The Theatre of Fortification:</b> tasked to increase Boros weapons and battle effectiveness. Its commander is Tajic.</li>
          <li><b>The Theatre of Recruitment:</b> having the objective to find and indoctrinate members among the guildless that seem suitable to serve in the Legion.</li>
        </ul>
